ClipperzApp
-----------

ClipperzApp is a simple Android app that acts as a shortcut to access the 
Clipperz web password manager:
[https://clipperz.is/app/](https://clipperz.is/app/).

Clipperz is an «online vault and password manager that knows nothing about
you and your data». Clipperz is a great [free and open source project][1a].
You can check out the [Clipperz organization][1b] on GitHub. If you use
Clipperz you should support the project with a [donation][1c].


This app is very simple, it is just a [WebView][2] that visualizes the
Clipperz web-app page.

## Disclaimer

Whilst the app is very simple and the only think that it does is visualizing
a web page I have to stress that this is an **UNOFFICIAL** app. I am not
affiliated with the Clipperz project in any capacity and this app is a
personal project that I have built for my own personal use and convenience.

Seriously, let me stress the point again. I have built this app in one
afternoon following a (very nice) tutorial by Steven Sohcot on Medium:
[«Tutorial for displaying a website in an Andriod app using a WebView component»][3].

I have written it because I wanted to experiment with Android apps and I
needed a shortcut to Clipperz, also being a native app my phone's fingerprint
password manager recognizes it and let my use my fingerprint for authentication.

I have practically zero knowledge of Android app development and I can not
guarantee that this app is either free of bugs or as secure to use as the
Clipperz official website.

## Installing

To install the app on your device go to the [releases][4] page and download
the latest version of the `.apk`.  You should enable the possibility to
install apps from _"Unknown Sources"_ in your Settings.
This could be a security risk in principle so you should consider disabling
this option when you are done installing the app.
